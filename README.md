# Instagram Fake Accounts Detection using Deep Learning

This project is part of a published research paper titled **"Countering Social Media Cybercrime Using Deep Learning: Instagram Fake Accounts Detection."** The paper explores a new framework leveraging deep learning techniques, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, for detecting fake accounts on Instagram.

The research discusses:
- The challenges of identifying fake accounts on social media platforms.
- The proposed LSTM-based detection framework.
- Experimental results demonstrating improved accuracy and performance compared to traditional machine learning approaches.
- Future directions for enhancing fake account detection techniques.
